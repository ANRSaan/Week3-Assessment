        <h2>So, whatchu into?</h2>
            <div id="whatchuInto" class="answerDiv">
                <p>It's weird that you'd ask me here, but sure.  In no particular order, I'm into:
                    <li class="intoPoints">Writing music</li>
                    <li class="intoPoints">Playing music</li>
                    <li class="intoPoints">Traveling</li>
                    <li class="intoPoints">Playing a weird card game called Netrunner</li>
                    <li class="intoPoints">Taking fun hikes</li>
                    <li class="intoPoints">Finally, and this may come as a shock, recently I've been spending a lot of my time learning to code and coding</li>           
                </p>
            </div>

        <h2>Okay, okay, I see you.  But you got any skills?</h2>
            <div id="skillz" class="answerDiv">
                <p>Honestly, it feels like my list of skills has been growing daily.  I've always been good with music, but (as noted above) I've been doing a lot with not only learning to code, but also learning other skills surrounding the actual skillset of coding.  For example, and I feel kinda weird being proud of it, but I've gotten a LOT better with using the command line to do various tasks.  In the same vein, I'm now fairly comfortable using git, where previously I'd only used it a couple times.
                </p>
                <p>As for the actual coding skills, I've gotten fairly competent in Javascript, to the point where even if I have to look up a specific bit of syntax, I have a good chance of being able to understand and implement it.  I've previously coded some in Python, and I actually think coding in Javascript has made me grow stronger in that as well, just because I'm getting more used to how to think about certain problems, and how to find out where the gaps are in my knowlege in order to fill them.  HTML and CSS are almost entirely new to me, and although I'm not nearly as strong in these aspects (I mean, look at the state of this place) I do feel I've learned a lot in a fairly short period, and look forward to improving more in this area as well.</p>
            </div>

        <h2>Wow, that was *WORDY*.  Let's move on to career goals.</h2>
            <div id="careerGaols" class="answerDiv">
                <p>Fine, I'll keep this one shorter.  As far as career goals goes, I had originally wanted to find something using Python, because that's what I've felt most confortable in.  Honestly, though, I just want to transition into a career where I feel like I'm actually contributing toward something, regardless of the specific language.</p>
